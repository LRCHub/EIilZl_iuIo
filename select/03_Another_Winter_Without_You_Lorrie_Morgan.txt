Lookin' at the weatherman on the ten o'clock news
He says that there's another cold front movin' through
A cold rain's fallin' and it's turnin' to snow
I wish that he could tell me something
I don't already know
And I wonder can I weather
Another winter without you

November skies paint the mornin' ghostly gray
Gets dark so early that the nights drag on for days
A window pane rattles from the chilled northern breeze
And the TV stays on all night long
Just to keep me company

CHORUS
Got a chill in my bones
No blanket could warm
I could sure use your arms
In the face of this storm
Building fires for one ain't easy to do
And I wonder can I weather
Another winter without you

Spring will bring flowers to brighten up my days
Summer keeps me busy with the walks along the bay
Fall will bring colors with the changin' of the leaves
But I'm sure not lookin' forward
To the first winter freeze

Freezin' like these walls don't exist
Tremblin' at the thought of your kiss
Lonely's been cold but never like this
And I wonder can I weather
Another winter without you

REPEAT CHORUS

Yes, I wonder can I weather
One more winter without you
