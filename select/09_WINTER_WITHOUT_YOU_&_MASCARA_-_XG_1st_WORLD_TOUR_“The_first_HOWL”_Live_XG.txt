Ah-ah-ah
Uh, oh-ah

Every year right around this time
People putting up trees and lights
And I been thinking that this don't feel right
'Cause I'm without you
If I could make a list, you'd be the first in it
If I could make a wish, you'd show in a minute
Only if it was that way

But there's some things that I can't change

So now
This ain't winter without you
No more joy, no laughter
Wish that I could turn it back around
When I'm falling down
So how
How am I supposed to go without you?
Days gone cold so won't you
Say that you'll be home for Christmas

I don't care about no mistletoe (mistletoe)
On the DL I still miss you though (woah)
Looking cute at every Christmas party
Posting on my story, still a little snowy, yeah
Joyful, joyful, joyful, raise your voice
Everybody come and raise your voice
So now, hey
Let mе tell the truth

If I remеmber we would sit by the fire
Holding hands
Sweet smell of sugar and spice
Was heaven scent
But like the season you was gone with the wind
Fall winter spring
Back around with my December blues
I've been feeling again
So listen
I really wanna know where we went wrong
I wanna know if you would hear this song
And if I could turn back the time
You'd be in my arms again

But there's some things that I can't change

So now
This ain't winter without you
No more joy, no laughter
Wish that I could turn it back around
When I'm falling down
So how
How am I supposed to go without you?
Days gone cold so won't you
Say that you'll be home for Christmas

Heavy snow pouring out my window (window)
I pray to stars and the angels (oh)
No, no more lonely nights (no, no more lone—)
No way to hide why I need you for sure (need you for sure)
So I keep wishing and hoping
You'd walk through the door (walk through the door)
Hold me 'cause I know
We'll fight through the cold (fight through the storm)
As long as I am with my baby
Please hurry up, hurry up (hurry up, hurry up)
I'll be stayin' up all night

No matter what I unwrap in the morning (ooh-ooh)
I won't be the same, I'd playback every moment (every moment)
There's nobody else to run to
Believin' it like it's true
That you would come to rescue
I merry miss you

Now tell me how (now tell me how)
How am I supposed to go without you?
Days gone cold so won't you
Say that you'll be home for Christmas (ooh, baby talk to me now)
So now
This ain't winter without you (this is where I'm going down)
No more joy, no laughter (no need to worry about)
Wish that I could turn it back around (let me turn it around)
When I'm falling down (when it's all falling down)
So how
How am I supposed to go without you? (Just tell me how)
Days gone cold so won't you (so baby won't you)
Say that you'll be home for Christmas
